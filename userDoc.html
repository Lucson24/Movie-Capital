   Welcome to movie Capital. This document will provide guidelines to navigate our website. This is divided into two sections:
<br> 1-	Public area
<br> 2-	Private area
<br> <b> Public Area </b>
Observe the main menu that is located at the upper part of the screen. Click on an option to see its contents. Menu contains: 
<br>-	Home
<br>-	About
<br>-	FAQ
<br>-	REVIEWS
<br>-	CONTACT
<br>-	PRIVACY POLICY
<br>-	TERMS OF SERVICE

<br> <b>Private Area</b>
<br>To access the private area, you have to be registered first. At the home page, there is a button called login/register; click on that button. 
This button will take to a login page. Below the login credentials, there is a button called 'register'. Click on this button. This will take you to a register page. Fill out the form to register. When choosing an username, avoid signs like - ? $. Enter a valid email address; this will be checked. You need to be at least 18 years old to access our services. 
After successful registration, you will be directed to an user profile. If you like, you may upload a user profile picture. Just select the 'upload picture' option in the user menu. You can also change your password, your username, and your email address
Perhaps the most important functionality on this profile is the ability to search movies. Click on the button 'search movies' in the lower part of the user profile menu. This will direct you to a questionnaire, in which you have to select preferences for movie genre, movie rating, and discount. After choosing your preference, click on submit. You will be directed to a page that shows a list of all movies that fulfill your preferences. These are divided into three categories: 
<br> 1-	Perfect Match: The movie or movies that satisfy all your requirements 
<br> 2-	Recommendations: Movies that satisfy only two of your requirements 
<br>3-	Suggestions: Movies that satisfy only one of your requirements. 
 <br> To add a movie to the cart, just click on it. If you want to take a movie out of the cart, click on the movie again. After you selected all movies that you are interested in buying, just click on the check out button located in the upper-right part of the screen. Then an alert box will show you all movies on cart. Click accept if you want to proceed to check out. Congratulations! You have completed your first purchase.
