  Admin documentation

<p>
  Welcome to movie capital! This document offers broad guidelines on how to use your admin account. It is divided into 3 steps: 
<br>1-	Access admin log in page
<br>2-	Manipulate Movies
<br>3-	Manipulate User accounts. 

<br> <b>Access admin log in page </b>
<br>To access the features of your admin account, you first have to login into it. Go to the home page of the website. Click on the button that says: register/login, at the center of the page. This will direct you to a login page. This is only for user accounts, not for administrators. To access the admin log in, click on the button called 'admin login' that is below the user log in fields. This will take you to the admin log in page. Enter your credentials, and you will access the admin account main page. 

 <br> <b>Manipulate Movies</b>
<br>As an administrator, you have the capacity to modify the product info. You may add a new movie, remove a movie, change a title, change a genre, change a price, etc. These functions are accessed through the menu found at the upper section of the admin account main page. Click on the desired option to start. Often, you need to provide the name of the movie that you would like to modify. Make sure to spell the name right; otherwise, you will not be successful in modifying the product. There is a sensitivity to upper case and lower case. If you do not know the correct spelling of a particular movie, you may check it on the database records. 

<br> <b> Manipulate User Records. </b> 
As an administrator, you have the capacity to add and remove users; also, you can modify the username and password of a particular user account. Finally, you can grant a movie to a user, or the opposite, that is, deprive a user of a movie. To access all the above mentioned features, you have to access the menu at the bottom of the admin account main page. Click one a desired option to proceed. As was the case with the functionality to modify movies, you will often be asked to provide the username of the user you intend to affect. As usual, pay attention to the spelling. Count on case sensitivity. If you are not sure of the correct spelling, check the database records.
